<h3>THE IMPROMPTU CHARADE-PARTY.</h3>

<blockquote><p>
SCENE&mdash;<i>The Library of a Country-House; the tables and chairs are
heaped with brocades, draperies, and properties of all kinds,
which the Ladies of the company are trying on, while the men
rack their brains for a suitable Word. In a secluded corner,</i>
Mr. NIGHTINGALE <i>and</i> MISS ROSE <i>are conversing in whispers.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Whipster</i> (<i>Stage-Manager and Organiser&mdash;self-appointed</i>).
No&mdash;but I say, <i>really</i>, you know, we <i>must</i> try and decide on
something&mdash;we've
been out half an hour, and the people will be getting
impatient! (<i>To the Ladies</i>.) Do come and help; it's really no
use dressing up till we've settled what we're going <i>to do</i>. Can't
<i>anybody</i> think of a good Word?</p>

<p><i>Miss Larkspur</i>. We ought to make a continuous story of it, with
the same plot and characters all through. We did that once at
the Grange, and it was awfully good&mdash;just like a regular Comedy!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Whipster</i>. Ah, but we've got to hit on <i>a Word</i> first.
Come&mdash;nobody
got an idea? NIGHTINGALE, you're not much use over
<i>there</i>, you know. I hope you and Miss ROSE have been putting
your heads together?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Nightingale</i> (<i>confused</i>). Eh? No, nothing of the sort! Oh,
ah&mdash;yes, we've thought of a <i>lot</i> of Words.</p>

<p><i>Miss Rose</i>. Only you've driven them all out of our heads again!</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>They resume their conversation</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Wh.</i> Well, do make a suggestion, somebody! Professor,
won't <i>you</i> give us a Word?</p>

<p><i>Chorus of Ladies</i>. Oh, <i>do</i>, Professor&mdash;you're sure to think of
something clever!</p>

<p><i>Professor Pollen</i> (<i>modestly</i>). Well, really, I've so little experience
in these matters that&mdash;A Word <i>has</i> just occurred to me,
however; I don't know, of course, whether it will meet with
approval&mdash;(<i>he beams at them with modest pride through his
spectacles</i>)&mdash;it's "Monocotyledonous."</p>

<p><i>Chorus of Ladies</i>. Charming! Monocottle&mdash;Oh, can't we <i>do</i>
that?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Wh.</i> (<i>dubiously</i>). We might&mdash;but&mdash;er&mdash;what's it
<i>mean</i>?</p>

<p><i>Prof. Pollen</i>. It's a simple botanical term, signifying a plant
which has only one cup-shaped leaf, or seed-lobe. Plants with <i>two</i>
are termed&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Wh.</i> I don't see how we're going to act a plant with only
one seed-lobe myself&mdash;and then the syllables&mdash;"mon"&mdash;"oh"&mdash;"cot"&mdash;"till"&mdash;we
shouldn't get done before <i>midnight</i>, you know!</p>

<p><i>Prof. Pollen</i> (<i>With mild pique</i>). Well, I merely threw it out as a
suggestion. I thought it could have been made amusing. No doubt I
was wrong; no doubt.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Settee</i> (<i>nervously</i>). I've thought of a word. How
would&mdash;er&mdash;"<i>Familiar</i>" do?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Wh.</i> (<i>severely</i>). Now, <i>really</i>. SETTEE, <i>do</i> try not to
footle like
this! [Mr. SETTEE <i>subsides amidst general disapproval</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Flinders</i>. (<i>With a flash of genius</i>). I've got it&mdash;<i>Gamboge</i>!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Wh.</i> Gamboge, eh? Let's see how that would work:&mdash;"Gam"&mdash;"booge."
How do you see it yourself?</p>

<blockquote><p>
[Mr. FLINDERS <i>discovers, on reflection, that he doesn't see it, and
the suggestion is allowed to drop</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Miss Pelagia Rhys</i>. <i>I've</i> an idea. <i>Familiar!</i>
"Fame"&mdash;"ill"&mdash;"<i>liar</i>,"
you know. [<i>Chorus of applause.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Wh.</i> Capital! The very thing&mdash;congratulate you, Miss RHYS!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Settee</i> (<i>sotto voce</i>). But I say, look here, <i>I</i> suggested
that,
you know, and you said&mdash;!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Wh.</i> (<i>ditto</i>). What on earth <i>does</i> it matter who suggests
it, so
long as it's right? Don't be an ass, SETTEE! (<i>Aloud</i>.) How are we
going to do the first syllable "Fame," eh? [Mr. SETTEE <i>sulks</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Pushington</i>. Oh, that's easy. One of us must come on as a
Poet, and all the ladies must crowd round flattering him, and making
a lot of him, asking for his autograph, and so on. I don't mind doing
the Poet myself, if nobody else feels up to it.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>He begins to dress for the part by turning his dress-coat inside
out, and putting on a turban and a Liberty sash, by way of
indicating the eccentricity of genius; the Ladies adorn themselves
with a similar regard to realism, and even more care
for appearances.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<h4>AFTER THE FIRST SYLLABLE.</h4>

<blockquote><p>
<i>The Performers return from the drawing-room, followed
by faint applause</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Pushington</i>. Went capitally, that syllable, eh? (<i>No
response.</i>)
You might have played up to me a little more than you did&mdash;you
others. You let me do everything!</p>

<p><i>Miss Larkspur</i>. You never let any of us get a word in!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Pushington</i>. Because you all talked at once, that was all.
Now then&mdash;"ill." I'll be a celebrated Doctor, and you all come to
me one by one, and say you're <i>ill</i>&mdash;see?</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>Attires himself for the rôle of a Physician in a dressing-gown
and an old yeomanry helmet</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Mr. Whipster</i> (<i>huffily</i>). Seems to me I may as well go and sit with
the audience&mdash;I'm no use <i>here</i>!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Pushington</i>. Oh, yes, WHIPSTER, I want you to be my confidential
butler, and show the patients in.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[Mr. W. <i>accepts&mdash;with a view to showing</i> PUSHINGTON <i>that other
people can act as well as he</i>.
</p></blockquote>

<h4>AFTER THE SECOND SYLLABLE.</h4>

<p><i>Mr. Pushington</i>. Seemed to <i>drag</i> a little, somehow! There was
no necessity for you to make all those long soliloquies, WHIPSTER. A
Doctor's confidential servant wouldn't chatter so much!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Whipster</i>. You were so confoundedly solemn over it, I had to
put some fun in <i>somewhere</i>!</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> Well, you might have put it where someone could see it.
Nobody laughed.</p>

<p><i>Professor Pollen</i>. I don't know, Mr. PUSHINGTON, why, when I
was describing my symptoms&mdash;which I can vouch for as scientifically
correct&mdash;you persisted in kicking my legs under the table&mdash;it was
unprofessional, Sir, and extremely painful!</p>

<p><i>Mr. Pushington</i>. I was only trying to hint to you that as there
were a dozen other people to follow, it was time you cut the interview
short, Professor&mdash;that one syllable alone has taken nearly an hour.</p>

<p><i>Miss Buckram</i>. If I had known the kind of questions you were
going to ask me, Mr. PUSHINGTON, I should certainly not have
exposed myself to them. I say no more, but I must positively decline
to appear with you again.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Pushington</i>. Oh, but really, you know, in Charades one gets
carried away at times. I assure you, I hadn't the remotest (&amp;c.,
&amp;c.&mdash;<i>until</i>
Miss BUCKRAM <i>is partly mollified</i>.) Now then&mdash;last syllable.
Look here, I'll be a regular impostor, don't you know, and all of you
come on and say what a liar I am. We ought to make that
screamingly funny!</p>

<h4>AFTER THE THIRD SYLLABLE.</h4>

<p><i>Mr. Pushington</i>. Muddled? Of <i>course</i> it was muddled&mdash;you all
called me a liar before I opened my mouth!</p>

<p><i>The Rest</i>.&mdash;But you didn't seem to know how to begin, and we
<i>had</i> to bring the Word in somehow.</p>

<p><i>Pushington</i>. Bring it in?&mdash;but you needn't have let it <i>out</i>.
There was SETTEE there, shouting "liar" till he was black in the face. We
must have looked a set of idiots from the front. I shan't go in again
(<i>muttering</i>). It's no use acting Charades with people who don't
understand it. There; settle the Word yourselves!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>

<h4>AFTER THE WORD. AMONG THE AUDIENCE.</h4>

<p><i>General Murmur</i>. What <i>can</i> it be? Not <i>Turk</i>, I suppose,
or
Magician?&mdash;Quarrelling?&mdash;Parnellite?&mdash;Impertinence? Shall we
give it up? No, they like us to guess, poor things; and besides, if
we don't, they'll do another; and it is getting <i>so</i> late, and such a
<i>long</i> drive home. Oh, they're all coming back; then it is over. No,
indeed, we can't <i>imagine. "Familiar</i>!" To be sure&mdash;<i>how</i> clever,
and <i>how</i> well you all acted it, to be sure&mdash;you must be quite tired
after it all. I am sure <i>we</i>&mdash;hem&mdash;are deeply indebted to you ... My
dear Miss ROSE, how wonderfully you disguised yourself. I
never recognised you a bit, nor <i>you</i>, Mr. NIGHTINGALE. What part
did <i>you</i> take?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Nightingale</i>. I&mdash;er&mdash;didn't take any particular part&mdash;wasn't
wanted, you know.</p>

<p><i>Miss Rose</i>. Not to <i>act</i>,&mdash;so we stayed outside
and&mdash;and&mdash;arranged things.</p>

<p><i>An Old Lady</i>. Indeed? Then you had all the hard work, and none
of the pleasure, my dear, I'm afraid.</p>

<p><i>Miss Rose</i> (<i>sweetly</i>). Oh no. I mean yes!&mdash;but we didn't <i>mind</i>
it much.</p>

<p><i>The O.L.</i> And which of you settled what the Word was to be?</p>

<p><i>Mr. N.</i> Well, I believe we settled that together.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[<i>Carriages are announced; departure of guests who are not of
the house-party. In the Smoking-room</i>, Mr. PUSHINGTON
<i>discovers that he does not seem exactly popular with the
other men, and puts it down to jealousy</i>.

<h2>ROBERT'S XMAS BANKWET.</h2>

<p>We held our annywal Crismus Bankwet larst Satterday. Our
principel Toast of course was, "Success to the Grand Old Copperashun,
and may it flurrish for ewer!" with 3 times 3, and one
cheer more for the bewtifool LADY MARESS,
and may she flurrish for ewer too! Ah,
we Waiters is a gallarnt race and knows
our dooty to the fairer and weaker sects
quite as well as ewen Aldermen theirselves.
I next perposed the City Livvery
Compnys, in a speech, as BROWN said, as
ort for to be printed and sircculated. I
had serttenly given a good deal of atention
to it, and praps shood have dun ewen
better if I hadn't quite forgot ewery word
of the werry last part, which, unfortnitly,
was all about the lots of money as they
gives away. But I remembred all about
their luvly dinners, and that was naterally more intresting to my
hordience. I was werry much pressed to say which, in my opinion,
of all the Nobel Livvery Cumpnys guv the most nobly scrumpshus
Dinners of 'em all, but I declined, on the ground that it wood naterally
cause a most enormous emount of gelosy, and was of too delicat
and xquisit a natur to be thus publicly discussed. There was
werry considerabel diffrens of opinion about their warious choice
wines, but all agreed in praising them werry hily, but ewen more,
the trew libberality with which they was served, and not poured
out so close as to make the pore Waiter's dooty a thirsty and
tanterlising one indeed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:20%;"><a href="images/4-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/4-1.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>We drank the Nobel Army of Hotel Keepers, most serttenly not
forgettin the gentlemanly Manager of the truly "Grand," as ewerybody
knows as is anybody, and drank to their great success, for
werry ewident reesons.</p>

<p>Young FRANK returned thanks for the Ladies, and, with all the
reckless ordassity of a young feller of forty, was rash enuff to say,
as how as he werrily believed, that if the prinsiple Hotel Keepers was
to hintroduce pretty Gals as Waiters, all us old Fogys, as he rudely
called us, woud have to go and git our seweral livings in a more
manly employment! Of course boys will be boys, so we kindly
forgave him, more specially as he stands six foot one in his
stockings, let alone his boots. However he made up for his bad
manners by singing with his capital voice, his new Song of "<i>Old
Robert the Waiter</i>" being a rayther complementary Parody, as he
called it, upon "<i>Old Simon the Cellerer</i>," which was receeved with
emense aplause. So he gave, as an arncore, the Waiter's favrite
Glee of "<i>Mynear Van Dunk</i>," with its fine conwincing moral against
Teetotaling and all such cold rubbish.</p>

<p>BROWN wound up the armony of our truly appy heavening by
singing his new song of, "The LORD MARE leads a nappy life," and
we sort our seweral nupshal couches as happy and contented a lot as
his Lordship hisself, our werry larst drink all round being to the
follering sentiment given out by me as the prowd Chairman: "May
all the well to do in this grand old London of ours enjoy as merry a
Crismus as we have enjoyed to-night, and may they all give a kind
thort, and a liberal stump-up, to all the poor and needy who so badly
wants it this bitter weather." ROBERT.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<div class="figright" style="width:28%;"><a href="images/4-2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/4-2.png" alt="" /></a>Toll'd after Supper. Subject for a Knellegy.</div>

<p>MR. JEROME K. JEROME, or, more easily pronounced, "Mr. JERUMKY
JERUM," is occasionally very amusing in his book for Christmastide,
entitled <i>Told After Supper</i>. What he wants, that is, what he
ought to have whether he wants it or not, is judicious
editing. Had this process been applied to this eccentric
haphazardy book, scarcely more than a third
of it would have been published. "His style, in this
book at least, and, for my part," says the Baron, "I
say the same of his <i>Three Men in a Tub</i>, suggests the
idea of his writing being the work of a young man
who, among his companions
and admirers, has earned the reputation of being a 'deuced funny
chap,' and so has to struggle to live up to this reputation, or to live
it down." JERUMKY JERUM still somewhat affects Yankee humour,
not, however, in so forced and vulgar a manner as in his overpraised
<i>Three Men in a Boat</i>. Two of the Ghost Stories are
humorous, but their setting is unworthy of them. Had they been
introduced into a tale as DICKENS (of whose style there is a very
palpable attempt at imitation in the description of a stormy winter's
night) brought in his story of <i>Tom Smart</i>, and of the inimitable
<i>Gabriel Grub</i>, their mirth-raising value would have been considerably
enhanced. As it is, these choice morsels&mdash;sandwich'd in
between heavy slabs of doughy material&mdash;stand a chance of not
being tasted. To anyone who comes across the book the Baron says,
"read about the Curate and the Card-trick, and JOHNSON and
EMILY. The tinted paper on which it is printed is a mistake, as
are also most of the amateurish illustrations."</p>

<p><i>WOMAN</i>&mdash;not "lovely woman" who "stoops to folly"&mdash;nor woman
who in our hour of ease is uncertain, coy, and hard to please. But
Woman, the weekly <i>Woman</i> who is doing uncommonly well and
in her fifty-third number, gave the week before Christmas, her idea
of a Christmas dinner, and, but for "sweetbread cutlets," a very
good and simple dinner it was. The same <i>Woman</i> gave also, among
a variety of next-day's treatments of Turkey, <i>Turkey in Aspic</i>,
Turkey in Europe, and Turkey in Asia&mdash;yes&mdash;but what about
"Turkey in Aspic"? It doesn't look well; much better in French.
But we dare say it's very good, though, for breakfast or supper,
"devilled Turkey" is "hard to beat."</p>

<p>I have been trying to read LEIGH HUNT. His Biography interested
me muchly, and I had always heard, in time past, so much of his
writings, though I do not remember ever having heard
the titles of his works mentioned, that, when a neat-looking
volume was sent me by Messrs. PATERSON &amp; Co.
of <i>Leigh Hunt's Tales</i>, I anticipated great pleasure
from their perusal. Alas! the pleasure was only in
anticipation. I have tried, as the song says, "A little
bit here, and a little bit there&mdash;Here a bit,
There a bit, And everywhere
a bit,"&mdash;but, hang me, says the Baron, if I can tackle any
one of them. The matter doesn't interest me, and the style doesn't
fascinate me. This may be rank heresy, but I can't help it. I
have tried, and failed. Well, better to have tried, and failed, than
never to have tried at all. But I shan't try again,&mdash;at least, not
on this collection of Tales.</p>

<p>PARS ABOUT PICTURES.&mdash;A good collection of pictures and
sculpture&mdash;including
works by Messrs. BURNE-JONES, ONSLOW FORD,
ALFRED GILBERT, W.L. WYLLIE, and others&mdash;is on view at the
Royal Arcade Gallery, Old Bond Street. These are to be sold for
the benefit of the family of R.A. LEDWARD, the clever young
sculptor, who died only a few weeks ago. Lots more to say, but
you won't stand it, and will probably say, "<i>Par! si bête</i>!" So no

<h2>A FORECAST FOR 1891.</h2>

<h4>(<i>Being some Extracts from the Gloomy Outlooker's Diary.</i>)</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/5-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/5-1.png" alt="" /></a><p><i>Old Sol</i>. "Happy New Year, Mr. Punch!"</p>

<p><i>Mr. P.</i> "Hope we shall see something more of you in future!"</p></div>

<p><i>January</i>.&mdash;Continuation of "good old-fashioned winter." London
"snowed up." Locomotion by Hansom drawn by four drayhorses,
the fare from Charing Cross to Bayswater being £2 15<i>s.</i> Milk, 10<i>s.</i>
the half-pint, meat unprocurable. Riot of Dukes at the Carlton to
secure the last mutton chop on the premises, suppressed by calling out
the Guards. People in Belgravia burn their banisters for want of
coals. The Three per Cents go down to 35.</p>

<p><i>February</i>.&mdash;Railway incursion into the centre of the Metropolis
makes progress. Sir EDWARD WATKIN gets his line through Lords,
crosses Regent's Park, comes down Bond Street, and secures a large
centre terminus in the Green Park, with a frontage of a quarter of a
mile in Piccadilly.</p>

<p><i>March</i>.&mdash;Football atrocities on the increase. A match is played
at the Oval between the Jaw Splitting Rovers and the Spine Cracking
Wanderers, in which nine are left dead on the field, and fifteen are
carried on stretchers to the nearest hospital.</p>

<p><i>April</i>.&mdash;Increase of danger from electricity. A couple of large
metropolitan hotels catching fire from over-heated wires, nineteen
waiters, twenty-three policemen, and fifty-five members of the fire
brigade getting entangled in them in their efforts to extinguish the
flames, are killed on the spot, much to the satisfaction of the
holders of gas shares.</p>

<p><i>May</i>.&mdash;The "Capital and Labour" Question reaches an acute
stage. The "Unemployed Other People's Property Rights League"
being patted on the back by philanthropists, formulate their programme,
and seize the Stock Exchange and the Mansion House.</p>

<p><i>June</i>.&mdash;The "Capital and Labour" Question reaching a still acuter
stage, 20,000 unemployed East End Lodgers break into the Bank of
England, and give a banquet to the LORD MAYOR and Corporation to
celebrate the event, at which Mr. Sheriff AUGUSTUS HARRIS, in returning
thanks for the "Arts and Sciences," says he thinks "the takings"
of their hosts must have been "enormous."</p>

<p><i>July</i>.&mdash;Results of Gen. BOOTH's "Darkest England" scheme.
Triumphant return of the Submerged Tenth, who having enjoyed
themselves immensely, have come back to the Slums with a view to
having another innings at "the way out."</p>

<p><i>August</i>.&mdash;The Authorities at the Naval Exhibition wishing to
stimulate the public taste for the undertaking, fire one of the hundred-ton
guns which, "by some oversight" being loaded, sends a shell
into the City, which brings down the dome of St. Paul's, but, bursting
itself, lays Chelsea in ruins, and causes the appearance of a letter in
the <i>Times</i> from Lord GEORGE HAMILTON, saying that the matter will
be "the subject of a searching inquiry" by his Department.</p>

<p><i>September</i>.&mdash;A few Dukes in the Highlands, using several
Hotchkiss guns with their guests asked down to the shooting,
exceed the known figures of any previous <i>battue</i> to such an extent
that birds sell in Bond Street at <i>3d</i>. a brace, with the result that
the whole of Scotland is said to be completely cleared of game for the
next seven years.</p>

<p><i>October</i>.&mdash;The great strike of everybody commences. Nothing to
be got anywhere. Several Noblemen and Members of Parliament
meet the "food" crisis by organising an Upper-class Co-operative
Society, and bring up their own cattle to London. Being, however,
unable to kill them professionally without the aid of a butcher,
they blow them up with gunpowder, and divide them with a steam-scythe,
for which proceedings they are somewhat maliciously
prosecuted by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>

<p><i>November</i>.&mdash;The Strike continuing, and times being very bad,
several Peers take advantage of the 5th of the month, and make a
tour of their immediate neighbourhoods in their own arm-chairs,
thereby realising a very handsome sum in halfpence from a not
unsympathetic public.</p>

<p><i>December</i>.&mdash;First signs of a probable second edition of a "good
old-fashioned Christmas" recognised. General panic in consequence.
Attempt to lynch the Clerk of the Weather at Greenwich, only
frustrated by the appearance of a strong force of Police. 1891
terminates in gloomy despair.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;I beg of you to hear my tale of woe,</p>
<p>My case is really one of those I'm sure you'd like to know;</p>
<p>How EDWIN and myself, at last, have quarrelled and have parted,</p>
<p>And I am left to shed a tear&mdash;alone, and broken-hearted.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>We were engaged for eighteen months&mdash;he often said that life</p>
<p>Would not be worth the living, if I would not be his wife.</p>
<p>My eyes, though brown, were "blue" to him, my hair a "silken tangle,"</p>
<p>He'd given me his photograph, and such a lovely bangle!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>I had called upon his mother, and had often stayed to tea&mdash;</p>
<p>She said that EDWIN had, indeed, a lucky catch in me.</p>
<p>I thought him quite a model youth&mdash;hard-working, loyal, steady,</p>
<p>A thrill of pleasure filled me when he wrote, "Your own, own EDDY.",</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Oh! a brighter and a gladder day is surely never known</p>
<p>Than when EDWIN calls his darling ANGELINA his "own own."</p>
<p>It warmed me with the glow of love, it cheered me up when lonely,</p>
<p>Yet I didn't feel so happy, when it came to be, "Yours only."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The extra syllable indeed did not increase the charm,</p>
<p>I tried, however, to believe it didn't mean much harm;</p>
<p>So confident was I that naught our love could hurt or sever,</p>
<p>But it looked suspicious when next time he only put, "Yours ever."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>He only called me darling once! how different from before!</p>
<p>Oh, could it be he liked me less (or other maiden more)?</p>
<p>And was he tired of me&mdash;the girl he loved so fondly, dearly?</p>
<p>It could not be! And then he wrote, "I am, Yours most sincerely."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Yes&mdash;was he going to fling me off as though a worn-out glove?</p>
<p>You can't do with Sincerity if what you need is Love!</p>
<p>I could not think such ill of him, although it did look queerly,</p>
<p>That in his next the "most" was gone, and he was mine "sincerely."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Yet even then I loved him still, for in the human breast</p>
<p>Hope springs eternal, so I dared to hope on for the best;</p>
<p>And, after all, such things as these ought not to weigh unduly,</p>
<p>But it <i>was</i> more than I could bear to have to read, "Yours truly."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The truth was clear&mdash;I quickly sent him back his lovely <i>cartes</i>,</p>
<p>His bangle, and his poetry of Cupid and his darts.</p>
<p>I said to him how grieved I was his love had thus miscarried&mdash;</p>
<p>And then I found out everything; alas! the wretch was married.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>So here am I, as beautiful as anyone I know,</p>
<p>You couldn't get a better wife, no matter where you go.</p>
<p>And if you know, dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>, a husband, say you've seen a</p>
<p>Nice girl, who'd make him happy and whose name is</p>

<p>WHY THE DUES WERE THEY DONE AWAY WITH?&mdash;Under the
beneficent influence of the early coal dews&mdash;subsequently spelt coal
dues&mdash;which have existed from the earliest times, City and Metropolitan
Improvements have sprung up into existence. Now, thanks
to ignorant, but well-meaning County Councillors, the coal dues
being abolished, up goes the price of coal, up go the rates, and there
is no surplus for improvement of any sort. If those ancient days of
coal dues were considered "hard times," then sing we, in chorus,
"Hard times, come again once more!"</p>

<p class="i4">At least, you're beginning most merrily.</p>
<p class="i10">      Under the Mistletoe Bough</p>
<p class="i10">      You make a good start, anyhow.</p>
<p class="i2">With a kiss from the lips that can never betray,</p>
<p class="i2">There's many a girl would be greeted <i>that</i> way!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>You're welcome, my lad! It is <i>Punch's</i> old style</p>

<p>In winters of chill discontent he'll still smile,</p>
<p class="i4"><i>His</i> warmth seems to turn 'em to Summers!</p>
<p class="i10">      Under the Mistletoe Bough</p>
<p class="i10">      All doldrums are bosh and bow-wow.</p>
<p class="i2">He doesn't mix rue in his big New Year Bowl,</p>
<p class="i2">Whose aim is to cheer up the national soul.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p><i>Sursum corda</i>! That motto's the best of the bunch;</p>
<p class="i2">Make it yours, young New Year, and 'twill keep up your pecker.</p>

<p class="i4">Never helped one in heart or exchequer,</p>
<p class="i10">      Under the Mistletoe Bough</p>
<p class="i10">      You cannot do better, I vow,</p>
<p class="i2">Than make that same maxim your boyhood's first rule,</p>
<p class="i2">As your very first tip in your very first school.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Don't look like a pedagogue, do I, my lad?</p>

<p>Like him who made juvenile FLACCUS so sad.</p>
<p class="i4">How well the Venusian knows us!</p>
<p class="i10">      Under the Mistletoe Bough</p>
<p class="i10">      <i>He</i> never kissed maid, but somehow</p>
<p class="i2">Our Dickensish Season he seemed to divine</p>
<p class="i2">With his fondness for friendship, and laughter, and wine.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>No, boy, I don't greatly believe in the birch,</p>
<p class="i2">(Though sometimes my <i>bâton</i> must play&mdash;on rogues' shoulders.)</p>
<p>Love's rather too apt to be left in the lurch</p>
<p class="i4">By Orbilian smiters and scolders.</p>
<p class="i10">      Under the Mistletoe Bough</p>
<p class="i10">      A kiss is best treatment, I trow.</p>
<p class="i2">A salute from the lips of your <i>Punch</i> you'll not spurn,</p>
<p class="i2">And the young guests around you shall each take a turn.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The outlook, my lad, seems a little bit drear,</p>
<p class="i2">There are clouds and storm-shadows about the horizon,</p>
<p>But&mdash;well, you're a chubby and rosy Young Year</p>
<p class="i4">As ever your PUNCHY set eyes on.</p>
<p class="i10">      Under the Mistletoe Bough</p>
<p class="i10">      You look mighty kissable&mdash;now.</p>
<p class="i2">So here goes another, for luck like, my dear,</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Punch,&mdash;I venture to address
you on a subject that I feel sure will enlist
your kind attention and sympathy. How am
I to get through Yule Tide? Ought I to give
up the dispatch of "cards," or ought I to send
them to all my relatives, friends, and acquaintances?
If I drop the custom, people who
like me will think I am outting them, and
persons with whom I am less popular will
imagine that economy, not to say meanness,
is the cause of my ceasing to trouble the Post
Office. Suppose that I "hang the expense,"
and <i>do</i> send the cards. Well, I am in this
position; it is a matter of the greatest difficulty
to get a suitable greeting to all those
who receive my annual benediction. If I
have "Wishing you and yours every happiness,"
with my appended name and address
lithographed, the greeting seems cold, and
even inappropriate, if addressed to, say, a
favourite Maiden Aunt; and unduly familiar
if forwarded to the acquaintance I saw for
the first time in my life the day before
yesterday. Then if I trust to the ordinary
Christmas Cards of commerce, I am often at
a loss to select an appropriate recipient for a
nestful of owls, or the picture of a Clown
touching up an elderly gentleman of highly
respectable appearance with a red-hot poker!
If I get a representation of flowers, the chances
are ten to one that the accompanying lines
are of a compromising character. It is
obviously cruel to send to a recently-widowed
Uncle some verses about "<i>Darby and Joan</i>,"
and my Mother-in-law is not likely to feel
complimented if I forward to her a poetically
expressed suggestion that there is no pleasanter
place than her own home&mdash;away, of
course, from her Son-in-law! And yet these
are the problems that meet the would-be Yule
Tide card distributer at every turn! I remain,
my dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>, yours sincerely,</p>

<p>ONE WHO WISHES TO AVOID A ROW.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;If this arrives late, thank the cards
that have overtaxed the postal arrangements.</p>

<h2>IN THE LATEST STYLE.</h2>

<h4>(<i>By Our Intrepid Interviewer.</i>)</h4>

<p>Feeling that your readers would be interested
in learning Mr. CHOSE's own view of
the unpleasant affair, I called upon the
distinguished Arctic Explorer just as he was
sitting down to breakfast.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. CHOSE, is it really true," I
asked, "that you stole the umbrellas?"</p>

<p>The face of the warrior flushed angrily,
for a moment, and then regaining his composure,
he replied that he could not see the
point of possessing himself of articles that
would be absolutely valueless in those
extremely northern latitudes.</p>

<p>"That is not the question," I persisted.
"I am sure you will forgive me, when you
remember that I speak in the name of the
Public; but what I want, and what they want
to know is, Did you steal the umbrellas?
Now, Mr. CHOSE, you can surely answer Yes or No."</p>

<p>"I don't see what either you or they have
to do with it," replied the Arctic Explorer,
cutting off the top of a boiled egg, "but as a
matter of fact, I had nothing whatever to do
with any of the luggage of the expedition.
So, if it is said, that I walked about with a
shower-protector that was not my own, you
can value the story for what it is worth.
Why, on the very face of it, the report is
ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"Exactly," I agreed, "but, then, the
world is uncharitable. However, Mr. CHOSE,
perhaps you can tell me if it is true that your
friend and colleague, Mr. BLANK, converted
an aged Esquimaux into what he termed
Iced Greenlander?"</p>

<p>'I have heard the story, certainly; but
cannot say whether it
is true or not. When the incident is alleged
to have happened, I was in another part of the
country, having been sent there to change
novels at the local circulating library."</p>

<p>"But would you say it was probable?"</p>

<p>"Distinctly not. BLANK was a noble-hearted,
chivalrous, merry, gladsome, gallant
young fellow. He was the soul of honour.
Why," he added, with deep emotion, "I have
left as much as fourpence in coppers on a
mantel-piece alone with him, and on my
return nave found every halfpenny of the
money untouched!"</p>

<p>"Then do you not think he pushed the old
man into the sausage-machine?"</p>

<p>"If he did, it must have been either accidentally,
or to win a wager, or perhaps as
practical joke. That he would do anything open to censure at the
hands of the severest moralist, is absolutely incredible. Why, he
is a Loamshire man!"</p>

<p>"So I have heard; and, now, Mr. CHOSE, as I see that you have
finished your breakfast, I will put to you a purely personal question.
Is it true that you poisoned your grandmother, drowned your uncle,
stifled your niece, and hanged your brother-in-law?"</p>

<p>The Arctic Explorer pulled angrily at his moustache, and said
something about the reports to which I referred being exaggerated.</p>

<p>"And may I take it that you have never been in gaol for picking
pockets? And when it is said that you
were turned out of a Club for cheating at cards&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at this point I was assisted to take
my leave with so much abruptness, that I
was forced to leave my last question but partially
formulated. On finding myself once
more in the street, I noticed that I was
reclining in the gutter, bare-headed. A
little later, however, my hat was thrown after me.</p>

<h2>POLITICS UP TO DATE.</h2>

<h4>(<i>Specimen Leader from an Irish Paper in a Chronic State of Revolution.</i>)</h4>

<p>WEDNESDAY, 9 A.M.&mdash;We appear this morning
awaiting the future with confidence and
hope. So far, we have been able to conduct
this journal on patriotic lines. We have
denounced the Leader of the Party as the
enemy of his country, and have applauded
his opponents as the saviours of society.
But we cannot conceal from ourselves that
the time may arrive when this policy may
be reversed. The hour may come&mdash;</p>

<p>10 A.M.&mdash;It has! We have much pleasure
in informing our readers that, after a vigorous
fight (honourable to all who took part in it),
we have conquered. This paper is in our
hands, and henceforward we shall support,
to the best of our ability, the Leader of the
Party, and denounce the infamous pretensions
of his opponents; still, it would be unwise to
ignore the possibilities of the future. We
may be overpowered by a tyrannical majority.
The time may come&mdash;</p>

<p>11 A.M.&mdash;It has! Hurroo! It was hard
fighting to get back;
but here we are again,
ready to denounce the
leader, and support his
opponents. For the
moment we are victorious,
but who shall prophesy what may be
looming in the distant
ages? The hour may come&mdash;</p>

<p>12 NOON.&mdash;It has! And now that we have
again taken possession, we must say we have
never had so elegant a quarrel. The shillelaghs
were flinging about all over the place, cracking crowns
in all directions, and the scrimmages were
just magnificent! It was an elegant row
entirely! But now to work. Our noble
leader deserves his triumph, and his opponents
are nowhere. Still in the moment of victory, it would be
foolish to overlook the chances of to-morrow. The hour may come&mdash;</p>

<p>1 P.M.&mdash;It has! Be jabers, what a contest!
But we have just slaughtered them! Oh, it was a fine sight
entirely! How the ink-pots flew about! Easy now, let us to business.
The shorter we make our remarks the better, as no one can
say what will be happening hereafter. The hour may come&mdash;</p>

<p>2 P.M.&mdash;It has! With a vengeance! We have defeated them!
Hurroo, boys! This is not the time for composition! Tread on the tail
of my&mdash;we mean&mdash;our coat! Come on, ye dirty spalpeens! Hurroo!</p>

<h2>THE AMUSING RATTLE'S NOTE-BOOK FOR 1891.</h2>

<p><i>January</i>.&mdash;If dining out on the 1st, remember that the QUEEN
was created Empress of Hindostan on that date in 1877, although
the Opposition tried to <i>hinder her</i> from assuming the title. Work
this out. Lent Term commences at Oxford and Cambridge. Can't
be given away if only <i>lent</i>. This entertaining quibble (suitable to
five o'clock teas in Bayswater) can be applied to other topics. Note
the colours of the Universities, and bring in somehow "a fit of the
blues." On the 13th PITT died, on the 14th FOX was born. First
date suggestive of PITT, the second of <i>pity</i>. Good joke for the
Midlands. Put it down to SHERIDAN.</p>

<p><i>February</i>.&mdash;On the 3rd Lord SALISBURY born on St. Blaise's
festival. Consequently might be expected to set the Thames on fire.
This said with a sneer, should go splendidly at a second-rate Radical
luncheon-party. On the 14th, if you receive an uncomplimentary
missive, say it is less suggestive of <i>Valentine</i> than <i>Orson</i>.
This
capital jest should make you a welcome guest in places where they
laugh until the end of the month.</p>

<p><i>March</i>.&mdash;Not much doing. On the 8th Battle of Abookir, 1801.
If you take care to pronounce the victory <i>A-book-er</i>, you may
possibly
get a jest out of it in connection with a welshing transaction on
the turf, when you can call it "the defeat of <i>A-book-er</i>." Good at
a hunting-breakfast where the host is a nonagenarian, who can
observe "1801?&mdash;the year of my birth!"</p>

<p><i>April</i>.&mdash;Remember BISMARCK was born on the 1st, so it can't be
"<i>All</i> Fools' Day." Work this up to amuse a spinster aunt who
reads the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p><i>May</i>.&mdash;You may say of the 1st, if it is cold, that it is a "naughty
date." If you are asked for a reason for this assertion, apologise and
explain that you meant a "<i>Connaughty</i> date, for it is Prince ARTHUR's
Birthday." The claims of loyalty should secure for this quaint
conceit a right hearty welcome. In 1812, on the 22nd, GRISI the
celebrated songstress was born. At a distance of four hundred miles
from London, in extremely unsophisticated society, you may perhaps
venture something about the notes of this far-famed artist being
like "lubricated lightning" for evident reasons, but you must not
expect any one to laugh.</p>

<p><i>June</i>.&mdash;The name of this month may assist you to a joke here and
there in regard to a well-known ecclesiastical lawyer and Queen's
Counsel. This will be the more valuable, as the "remarkable days"
are few and far between, according to WHITAKER.</p>

<p><i>July</i>.&mdash;Note that on the 3rd the Dog Days commence, and that it
is also the anniversary of the Battle of Sadowa. If you pronounce
the victory "sad-hour" you should get a jest calculated to cause
merriment amongst persons who have spent the best years of their
lives on desert islands, or as Chancery Division Chief Clerks. On
the 24th the Window Tax was abolished, of which you may say that
although a priceless boon it was only a <i>light</i> relief. If you can
only introduce this really clever <i>bon mot</i> into a speech at a wedding
breakfast, a railway indignation meeting or a debate in the
House of Lords, it is sure to go with bowls not to say
shrieks. PENN died on the 30th, and in founding
Pennsylvania was mightier than the sword. This announcement
is the nearest approach to levity that in
common decency can be tolerated in a mourning coach.</p>

<p><i>August</i>.&mdash;On the 1st, in 1834, no less than 770,280
British slaves were freed. You might ask satirically,
how many slaves (be they husbands or be they wives)
now exist? You might offer this to a clergyman to
be used in a sermon. On the 26th, Anniversary of the
Battle of Cressy. Opportunity for saying (at the breaking-up
of an infant school) that on account of the
extremely warm reception to which the French were
welcomed on that occasion, the victory might be appropriately
called, "the Battle of Mustard-and-Cressy."
This will be found pleasing by a Colonial Briton home
on furlough, and an Honorary Royal Academician living
in retirement.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/12-2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/12-2.png" alt="" /></a><h4>ALWAYS ENTERTAINING;</h4>

<p>OR, VERY MUCH TAKEN CUM (CORNEY) GRAIN O!</p></div>

<p><i>September</i>.&mdash;On the 1st, Shooting at Partridges commences.
Opportunity for aiming old jokes about firing
off guns without loading, killing dead birds, &amp;c, &amp;c.
On the 3rd, the present Lord Chancellor born in 1825&mdash;the
name of GIFFARD entombed in Hals-<i>bury</i>. A little
obscure this, but, if carefully worked out, will amply
repay time and attention. On the 9th THOMAS WATTS
(who may be amusingly called "Watts-his-name"), died
in 1869. Not much in this, but may possibly fill up an
awkward pause during the reading of a will, or the
arrival of fresh hot water at a newly-married lady's
initial hospitality at five o'clock tea.</p>

<p><i>October</i>.&mdash;FIELDING, the novelist, <i>bowled out</i> on the
8th in 1754. Battle of Agincourt on the 25th&mdash;an awful
example to habitual drunkards. Pheasant-shooting
commences. Right time to tell that story about the
Cockney who, dropping his "h's," shot <i>peasants</i> instead!
This well-worn jest will be still found attractive by Australians
who have spent the better part of their lives in the Bush.</p>

<p><i>November</i>.&mdash;Good joke still to be made in the quieter suburbs
about having special appointments for the 5th, when one has to take
the chair at a meeting which perambulates the streets.
Lord Mayor's Day on the 9th&mdash;opportunity for letting
off "the Mayor the merrier," "£10,000 a Mayor's Nest-egg,"
&amp;c, &amp;c. Jests about the fog not now popular&mdash;the
infliction is too serious for jocularity!</p>

<p><i>December</i>.&mdash;Holiday time for everyone,
inclusive of that most melancholy of persons "the
funny man." BOB LOWE (born in 1811)
reaches the age of eighty, and the Grand Old Man
(born in 1809) eighty-two! With this ingenious quibble the Amusing
Rattle can wish himself a Merry Christmas, and the remainder of the
world a Happy New Year.</p>

<hr />

<p>APPROPRIATE.&mdash;Sir,&mdash;Was there ever a more appropriate Christmas
legal case than appeared in the <i>Times</i> Law Report, December
20th, and which was entitled "<i>The Mayor, &amp;c. of Bootle-cum-Linacre</i>
v. <i>The Justices of Lancashire</i>?" What delightful names
for a comic chorus to a <i>Bab Ballad</i> in a Pantomime.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><i>Solo</i>. Oh, did ye ne'er hear of His Worship the Mayor</p>
<p><i>Chorus</i>. Of Bootle-cum-Linacre diddle-cum-dee;</p>
<p><i>Solo</i>. Who went for the Justices of Lankyshare,</p>
<p><i>Chorus</i>. Singing Bootle-cum-Linacre diddle-cum-dee.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Too late for the Burlesques and the Pantomimes, but it may still be
serviceable at Music Halls and "places where they sing."</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
